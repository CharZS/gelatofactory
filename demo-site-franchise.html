												<h2 id="whyfranchise" class="font-weight-semibold custom-fs-1 line-height-3 ls-0 pt-3 mb-3 text-color-blue">Why Invest In A Franchise</h2>
												<p>According to a recent survey 90% of franchises report profitability in the first two years, compared to 50% of independent businesses going bust in that period of time. When you buy a franchise you are buying a tried-and-tested business model coupled with a team of experts who are there to support you every step of the way so that you don’t have to face the trials of business ownership on your own.</p>
												<h4>The advantages of investing in a franchise are many and far outweigh the disadvantages. </h4>
												<ul>
													<li>Using a proven business model and brand</li>
													<li>Using an established brand</li>
													<li>A licence to use the brand and systems</li>
													<li>Support from an expert team</li>
													<li>Having more credibility to secure funds from banks for the venture</li>
													<li>Having ongoing operational and marketing support</li>
													<li>Benefiting from invaluable training</li>
													<li>Access to an Operations manual</li>
													<li>Access to operating systems</li>
													<li>Access to preferred and nominated suppliers</li>
													<li>Reduced risk</li>
													<li>Control over your earnings</li>
													<li>No need to reinvent the wheel</li>
												</ul>
												<h4>These above make the franchisee’s task of setting up his/her store much easier. In general terms, the disadvantages of a franchise are the following: </h4>
												<ul>
													<li>Losing out on royalty fees</li>
													<li>Need to respect branding and operations guidelines</li>
													<li>Restrictions on trade and territories</li>
													<li>Entry costs</li>
													<li>Potential reliance on the franchisor</li>
												</ul>
												<p class="pb-1">However, while the pros by far outweigh the cons in a fiercely competitive environment, some of the disadvantages can be minimized with meaningful discussions. </p>

												<p>Superstar Pastry Chef and co-founder Chris Zammit comes from Malta. At the young age of 17, he enrolled in the Institute of Tourism Studies in his native country. Not sure where this would lead him, he studied Culinary Fine Arts and having terminated his studies, he worked in some of the finest hotels both in Malta and later in the UK, where he took up residence. Due to his creative talent, he was always encouraged to participate in national and international competitions and in a career spanning over 21 years, has seen him test his culinary skills in various international events, from Russia to the U.S.A, in pastillage, miniatures and butter sculptures. His forte however, has always been his ability to work with chocolate, creating incredible showpieces in all shapes and sizes, his latest being a 7 foot showpiece for a Chocolate Exhibition. He has learnt chocolate techniques under French MOF Stephanie Leroux (‘Un des MeilleursOuvriers de France’ loosely translated to ‘One of the best Craftsman in France’ – the highest honour one can receive in France. Meantime, he also studied the production of artisan icecream under MOF Luc Debove. </p>
												<p class="pb-1">His work has found favour with HM The Queen when he was commissioned to create a showpiece for her meeting with the King of Bahrain. He was also commissioned to create a butter sculpture for the TV show Ant & Dec and lately has also been filmed by Channel 5 during the creation of the 7’ chocolate sculpture. Chris is a proud member of England National Culinary Team and has represented Great Britain in various international competitions, amongst which was the Coupe du Monde de la Patisserie in Lyon, France. He is also a Chococommando, representing the top chocolate ice-cream brand Callebaut, his work involving him in giving lectures and tutorials on how to turn out the best chocolate ice-cream. </p>
